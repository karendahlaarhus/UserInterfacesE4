      Bali (/ˈbɑːli/) is a province of Indonesia and the westernmost of the
      Lesser Sunda Islands. East of Java and west of Lombok, the province
      includes the island of Bali and a few smaller neighbouring islands,
      notably Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, and Nusa Ceningan. The provincial
      capital, Denpasar, is the most populous city in the Lesser Sunda Islands
      and the second-largest, after Makassar, in Eastern Indonesia. The upland
      town of Ubud in Greater Denpasar is considered Bali's cultural centre. The
      province is Indonesia's main tourist destination, with a significant rise
      in tourism since the 1980s. Tourism-related business makes up 80% of its
      economy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bali is the only Hindu-majority province in Muslim-majority Indonesia,
      with 86.9% of the population adhering to Balinese Hinduism. It is renowned
      for its highly developed arts, including traditional and modern dance,
      sculpture, painting, leather, metalworking, and music. The Indonesian
      International Film Festival is held every year in Bali. Other
      international events held in Bali include the Miss World 2013 and 2018
      Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
      Group. In March 2017, TripAdvisor named Bali as the world's top
      destination in its Traveller's Choice award, which it also earned in
      January 2021.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bali is part of the Coral Triangle, the area with the highest biodiversity
      of marine species, especially fish and turtles. In this area alone, over
      500 reef-building coral species can be found. For comparison, this is
      about seven times as many as in the entire Caribbean. Bali is the home of
      the Subak irrigation system, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is also home
      to a unified confederation of kingdoms composed of 10 traditional royal
      Balinese houses, each house ruling a specific geographic area. The
      confederation is the successor of the Bali Kingdom. The royal houses are
      not recognised by the government of Indonesia; however, they originated
      before Dutch colonisation.

    <p>
      Brazil (Portuguese: Brasil; Brazilian Portuguese: ), officially the
      Federative Republic of Brazil (Portuguese: About this soundRepública
      Federativa do Brasil), is the largest country in both South America and
      Latin America. At 8.5 million square kilometers (3,300,000 sq mi) and with
      over 211 million people, Brazil is the world's fifth-largest country by
      area and the sixth most populous. Its capital is Brasília, and its most
      populous city is São Paulo. The federation is composed of the union of the
      26 states and the Federal District. It is the largest country to have
      Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas; it is
      also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations, due to
      over a century of mass immigration from around the world; as well as the
      most populous Roman Catholic-majority country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of 7,491
      kilometers (4,655 mi). It borders all other countries in South America
      except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area.
      Its Amazon basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse
      wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources
      spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage
      makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of
      significant global interest, as environmental degradation through
      processes like deforestation has direct impacts on global issues like
      climate change and biodiversity loss.
    </p>

    <p>
      Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in
      1500 of explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral, who claimed the area for the
      Portuguese Empire. Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 when the
      capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro. In
      1815, the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of
      the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Independence was
      achieved in 1822 with the creation of the Empire of Brazil, a unitary
      state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system.
      The ratification of the first constitution in 1824 led to the formation of
      a bicameral legislature, now called the National Congress. The country
      became a presidential republic in 1889 following a military coup d'état.
      An authoritarian military junta came to power in 1964 and ruled until
      1985, after which civilian governance resumed. Brazil's current
      constitution, formulated in 1988, defines it as a democratic federal
      republic. Due to its rich culture and history, the country ranks
      thirteenth in the world by number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

    <h1>Cape town, South Africa</h1>

    <p>
      Cape Town (Afrikaans: Kaapstad; , Xhosa: iKapa) is the oldest and second
      largest city in South Africa, after Johannesburg, and also the seat of the
      Parliament of South Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colloquially named the Mother City, it is the largest city of the Western
      Cape province and forms part of the City of Cape Town metropolitan
      municipality. The Parliament of South Africa is situated in Cape Town. The
      other two capitals are located in Gauteng (in Pretoria, the executive
      capital, where the Presidency is based) and in the Free State (in
      Bloemfontein, the judicial capital, where the Supreme Court of Appeal is
      located). The city is known for its harbour, for its natural setting in
      the Cape Floristic Region, and for landmarks such as Table Mountain and
      Cape Point. Cape Town is home to 66% of the Western Cape's population. The
      city was named the World Design Capital for 2014 by the International
      Council of Societies of Industrial Design.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2014, Cape Town was named the best place in the world to visit by both
      The New York Times and The Daily Telegraph. Cape Town has also been a host
      city for both the 1995 Rugby World Cup and 2010 FIFA World Cup, and
      annually hosts the Africa leg of the World Rugby 7s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Located on the shore of Table Bay, Cape Town, as the oldest urban area in
      the Western Cape, it was developed by the Dutch East India Company (VOC)
      as a supply station for Dutch ships sailing to East Africa, India, and the
      Far East. Jan van Riebeeck's arrival on 6 April 1652 established the VOC
      Cape Colony, the first permanent European settlement in South Africa. Cape
      Town outgrew its original purpose as the first European outpost at the
      Castle of Good Hope, becoming the economic and cultural hub of the Cape
      Colony. Until the Witwatersrand Gold Rush and the development of
      Johannesburg, Cape Town was the largest city in South Africa.

    <p>
      India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a
      country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the
      second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in the
      world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the
      southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders
      with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and
      Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the
      vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands
      share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar and Indonesia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than
      55,000 years ago. Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of
      isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second
      only to Africa in human genetic diversity. Settled life emerged on the
      subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years
      ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third
      millennium BCE. By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European
      language, had diffused into India from the northwest, unfolding as the
      language of the Rigveda, and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India.
      The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and
      western regions. By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had
      emerged within Hinduism, and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming
      social orders unlinked to heredity. Early political consolidations gave
      rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.
      Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity, but also
      marked by the declining status of women, and the incorporation of
      untouchability into an organised system of belief. In South India, the
      Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious
      cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and
      Zoroastrianism put down roots on India's southern and western coasts.
      Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern
      plains, eventually establishing the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern
      India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam. In the 15th
      century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu
      culture in south India. In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting
      institutionalised religion. The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two
      centuries of relative peace, leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.
      Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed,
      turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its
      sovereignty. British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to
      Indians were granted slowly, but technological changes were introduced,
      and ideas of education, modernity and the public life took root. A
      pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted
      for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British
      rule. In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two
      independent dominions, a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a
      Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an
      unprecedented migration.

    <p>
      Sydney (/ˈsɪdni/ (About this soundlisten) SID-nee; Dharug: Gadi; Greater
      Sydney, Dharug: Eora ) is the capital city of the state of New South
      Wales, and the most populous city in Australia and Oceania. Located on
      Australia's east coast, the metropolis surrounds Port Jackson and extends
      about 70 km (43.5 mi) on its periphery towards the Blue Mountains to the
      west, Hawkesbury to the north, the Royal National Park to the south and
      Macarthur to the south-west. Sydney is made up of 658 suburbs, spread
      across 33 local government areas. Residents of the city are known as
      "Sydneysiders". As of June 2020, Sydney's estimated metropolitan
      population was 5,367,206, meaning the city is home to approximately 66% of
      the state's population. Nicknames of the city include the 'Emerald City'
      and the 'Harbour City'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indigenous Australians have inhabited the Sydney area for at least 30,000
      years, and thousands of engravings remain throughout the region, making it
      one of the richest in Australia in terms of Aboriginal archaeological
      sites. Around 29 clan groups of the Eora Nation inhabited the region at
      the time of European contact. During his first Pacific voyage in 1770,
      Lieutenant James Cook and his crew became the first Europeans to chart the
      eastern coast of Australia, making landfall at Botany Bay and inspiring
      British interest in the area. In 1788, the First Fleet of convicts, led by
      Arthur Phillip, founded Sydney as a British penal colony, the first
      European settlement in Australia. Phillip named the settlement after
      Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney. Penal transportation to New South
      Wales ended soon after Sydney was incorporated as a city in 1842. A gold
      rush occurred in the colony in 1851, and over the next century, Sydney
      transformed from a colonial outpost into a major global cultural and
      economic centre. After World War II, it experienced mass migration and
      became one of the most multicultural cities in the world. At the time of
      the 2011 census, more than 250 different languages were spoken in Sydney.
      In the 2016 Census, about 35.8% of residents spoke a language other than
      English at home. Furthermore, 45.4% of the population reported having been
      born overseas, and the city has the third-largest foreign-born population
      of any city in the world after London and New York City. Between 1971 and
      2018, Sydney lost a net number of 716,832 people to the rest of Australia
      but its population has continued to grow, largely due to immigration.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite being one of the most expensive cities in the world, Sydney
      frequently ranks in the top ten most liveable cities in the world. It is
      classified as an Alpha Global City by Globalization and World Cities
      Research Network, indicating its influence in the region and throughout
      the world. Ranked eleventh in the world for economic opportunity, Sydney
      has an advanced market economy with strengths in finance, manufacturing
      and tourism. There is a significant concentration of foreign banks and
      multinational corporations in Sydney and the city is promoted as
      Australia's financial capital and one of Asia Pacific's leading financial
      hubs. Established in 1850, the University of Sydney was Australia's first
      university and is regarded as one of the world's leading universities.
      Sydney is also home to the oldest library in Australia, the State Library
      of New South Wales, opened in 1826.

      Morocco, officially the Kingdom of Morocco, is the northwesternmost
      country in the Maghreb region of North Africa. It overlooks the
      Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and has
      land borders with Algeria to the east, and the disputed territory of
      Western Sahara to the south. Morocco also claims the Spanish exclaves of
      Ceuta, Melilla and Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera, and several small
      Spanish-controlled islands off its coast. It spans an area of 446,550 km2
      (172,410 sq mi) or 710,850 km2 (274,460 sq mi), with a population of
      roughly 37 million. Its official and predominant religion is Islam, and
      the official languages are Arabic and Berber; the Moroccan dialect of
      Arabic and French are also widely spoken. Moroccan identity and culture is
      a vibrant mix of Berber, Arab, and European cultures. Its capital is
      Rabat, while its largest city is Casablanca.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inhabited since the Paleolithic Era over 90,000 years ago, the first
      Moroccan state was established by Idris I in 788. It was subsequently
      ruled by a series of independent dynasties, reaching its zenith as a
      regional power in the 11th and 12th centuries, under the Almoravid and
      Almohad dynasties, when it controlled most of the Iberian Peninsula and
      the Maghreb. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Morocco faced external
      threats to its sovereignty, with Portugal seizing some territory and the
      Ottoman Empire encroaching from the east. The Marinid and Saadi dynasties
      otherwise resisted foreign domination, and Morocco was the only North
      African nation to escape Ottoman dominion. The Alaouite dynasty, which
      rules the country to this day, seized power in 1631, and over the next two
      centuries expanded diplomatic and commercial relations with the Western
      world. Morocco's strategic location near the mouth of the Mediterranean
      drew renewed European interest; in 1912, France and Spain divided the
      country into respective protectorates, reserving an international zone in
      Tangier. Following intermittent riots and revolts against colonial rule,
      in 1956 Morocco regained its independence and reunified.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since independence, Morocco has remained relatively stable and prosperous.
      It has the fifth-largest economy in Africa and wields significant
      influence in both Africa and the Arab world; it is considered a middle
      power in global affairs and holds membership in the Arab League, the Union
      for the Mediterranean, and the African Union. Morocco is a unitary
      semi-constitutional monarchy with an elected parliament. The executive
      branch is led by the King of Morocco and the prime minister, while
      legislative power is vested in the two chambers of parliament: the House
      of Representatives and the House of Councillors. Judicial power rests with
      the Constitutional Court, which may review the validity of laws,
      elections, and referenda. The king holds vast executive and legislative
      powers, especially over the military, foreign policy and religious
      affairs; he can issue decrees called dahirs, which have the force of law,
      and can also dissolve the parliament after consulting the prime minister
      and the president of the constitutional court.

      The Carnival in Rio de Janeiro (Portuguese: Carnaval do Rio de Janeiro) is
      a festival held every year before Lent; it is considered the biggest
      carnival in the world, with two million people per day on the streets. The
      first Carnival festival in Rio occurred in 1723.
    </p>
    <p>
      The typical Rio carnival parade is filled with revelers, floats, and
      adornments from numerous samba schools which are located in Rio (more than
      200 approximately, divided into five leagues/divisions). A samba school is
      composed of a collaboration of local neighbours that want to attend the
      carnival together, with some kind of regional, geographical and common
      background.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a special order that every school has to follow with their parade
      entries. Each school begins with the "comissão de frente" (meaning "Front
      Commission"), that is the group of people from the school that appear
      first. Made of ten to fifteen people, the comissão de frente introduces
      the school and sets the mood and style of their presentation. These people
      have choreographed dances in elaborate costumes that usually tell a short
      story. Following the "comissão de frente" is the first float of the samba
      school, called "abre-alas" ("Opening Wing"). These are followed by the
      Mestre-sala and Porta-Bandeira ("Master of Ceremonies and Flag Bearer"),
      with one to four pairs, one active and three reserve, to lead the dancers,
      which include the old guard veterans and the "ala das baianas", with the
      drum line battery at the rear and sometimes a brass section and guitars.

      Santorini (Greek: Σαντορίνη, pronounced ), officially Thira (Greek: Θήρα )
      and classic Greek Thera (English pronunciation /ˈθɪərə/), is an island in
      the southern Aegean Sea, about 200 km (120 mi) southeast from the Greek
      mainland. It is the largest island of a small, circular archipelago, which
      bears the same name and is the remnant of a caldera. It forms the
      southernmost member of the Cyclades group of islands, with an area of
      approximately 73 km2 (28 sq mi) and a 2011 census population of 15,550.
      The municipality of Santorini includes the inhabited islands of Santorini
      and Therasia, as well as the uninhabited islands of Nea Kameni, Palaia
      Kameni, Aspronisi and Christiana. The total land area is 90.623 km2
      (34.990 sq mi). Santorini is part of the Thira regional unit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The island was the site of one of the largest volcanic eruptions in
      recorded history: the Minoan eruption (sometimes called the Thera
      eruption), which occurred about 3,600 years ago at the height of the
      Minoan civilization. The eruption left a large caldera surrounded by
      volcanic ash deposits hundreds of metres deep. It may have led indirectly
      to the collapse of the Minoan civilization on the island of Crete, 110 km
      (68 mi) to the south, through a gigantic tsunami. Another popular theory
      holds that the Thera eruption is the source of the legend of Atlantis.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is the most active volcanic centre in the South Aegean Volcanic Arc,
      though what remains today is chiefly a water-filled caldera. The volcanic
      arc is approximately 500 km (300 mi) long and 20 to 40 km (12 to 25 mi)
      wide. The region first became volcanically active around 3–4 million years
      ago, though volcanism on Thera began around 2 million years ago with the
      extrusion of dacitic lavas from vents around Akrotiri.
